//This is the JavaScript file for my first Code Louisville Front End Design class project - Special Education Portal

//This webpage will provide general resource information to users about special education
//information and services available at the federal, state, and local level

//Top section will use bootstrap carousel to cycle through options to select federal, state, or local information
//Middle section will use columns to display options to learn about success stories, resources, and share your story
//Bottom section will provide information about webinars and becoming a member of SPED Portal

//This project uses Bootstrap, a popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

//It uses responsive design by collapsing the navigation bar when screen size is small, changing the columns to row format in the middle section,
//and removing the webinar column in the bottom section

//This is an example of modifying a bootstrap course download with original content to show understanding of HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It is not
//meant to show off original design capabilities.
